We hypothesized that maternal excretion of hard fecal pellets and the coprophagous behavior of their pups were involved in cecal microbiota implantation. \n\n2.Evolution of gut microbial community through reproductive life in female rabbits and investigation of the link with offspring survival\nD Savietto 1, C Paës 1, L Cauquil 1, L Fortun-Lamothe 1, S Combes 1\n https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32618...\nAnimal. 2020 Nov;14(11):2253-2261.\nAbstract\nThe digestive microbiota plays a decisive role in shaping and preserving health throughout life. Rabbit younglings are born with a sterile digestive tract but then it gets progressively colonised by the microbiota of the nursing mother, by entering in contact with or ingesting the maternal droppings present in the nest.', 'DisLikes': '5', 'Duration': '24:55', 'Likes': '50', 'Publish_Date': '2016年6月8日', 'Subscribers': '3.25萬 位訂閱者', 'Title': '國一下生物5-1(3)生態角色-生產者、消費者、清除者', 'Views': '觀看次數：11,580次'}
